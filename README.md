   - It has 4 methods and a test for each.
   - Roll: accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times.
   - containsDuplicates: returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values
   - calculatingAverages:accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.
   - calculatingAveragesOfTwiArrays: calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.


# Lab03

basiclibrary directory contains 2 methods:
 - Analyze weather data: It iterates through 2d array to find the min and max element in the array. Finally, it iterates from min to max  and checks if that value exists in 
      hashset. It it does not exist, it prints out the values that are not in the set.
 - Tally: It takes a list of Strings and returns one strings to show who got the most votes.
Linter directory:
 - linter : It reads in js files via a PATH provided as a string. It reads each line on the file to see if the line is missing ';'. It skips the cases where the line is empty, 
     or the line ends with an opening curly brace, closing curly brace, or it contains if or else.
